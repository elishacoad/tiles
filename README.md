# Tiles

## Synopsis
This is an open-source project that allowes the addition of tiles to any webpage. Based off bootstrap, you can arrange your content into nice little tiles. Each  tile includes a background image, a title, and a description.

## Motivation
I was building my website, and wanted to add tiles as my main interface. I searched for a good library for tiles, and not finding anything to my liking, decided to make my own. After much work, I had what I wanted. I then thought if I already have all the code, why not make it open-source and help someone else in their search for the right tile library. So, here we are and here is the Tile Library. ;)
